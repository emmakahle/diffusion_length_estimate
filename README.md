Code for estimating diffusion lengths from ice core water isotope data. These files are currently configured to analyze the water isotope data from the South Pole ice core, but can be adjusted to analyze data sets from other cores as well.

This code accompanies the Kahle et al. 2018 paper:
Kahle, E. C., Holme, C., Jones, T. R., Gkinis, V., & Steig, E. J. (2018). A Generalized Approach to Estimating Diffusion Length of Stable Water Isotopes From Ice-Core Data. Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface, 123(10), 2377â€“2391. https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JF004764

This code runs in MATLAB. 
Estimate_diffusion.m is the main code to run. All dependent functions are included.

Also included are water isotope data from the South Pole ice core (SPC14). These data can be found in their original form and at cited at the USAP-DC (DOI: 10.15784/601396).
